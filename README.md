This repository contains code for predicting survival on the Titanic dataset using a decision tree algorithm. The dataset includes information about passengers such as their class, sex, age, and whether they survived or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset. It includes the following columns
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: 1 if the passenger survived, 0 otherwise
- Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female)
- Age: Age of the passenger in years
## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
#4. Follow the prompts to input passenger information such as class, sex, and age.
5. The script will output whether the passenger is predicted to survive or not based on the decision tree model.

## Model Training
The decision tree algorithm is trained using the Titanic dataset. The training process involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, fitting the decision tree model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy.
